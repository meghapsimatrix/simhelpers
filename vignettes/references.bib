	title = {Bootstrap-{Based} {Improvements} for {Inference} with {Clustered} {Errors}},
	abstract = {Researchers have increasingly realized the need to account for within-group dependence in estimating standard errors of regression parameter estimates. The usual solution is to calculate cluster-robust standard errors that permit heteroskedasticity and within-cluster error correlation, but presume that the number of clusters is large. Standard asymptotic tests can over-reject, however, with few (ﬁve to thirty) clusters. We investigate inference using cluster bootstrap-t procedures that provide asymptotic reﬁnement. These procedures are evaluated using Monte Carlos, including the example of Bertrand, Duﬂo, and Mullainathan (2004). Rejection rates of 10\% using standard methods can be reduced to the nominal size of 5\% using our methods.},
