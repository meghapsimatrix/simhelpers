Description: Calculates performance criteria measures and associated Monte Carlo standard errors for simulation results. Includes functions to help run simulation studies, following a general simulation workflow that closely aligns with the approach described by Morris, White, and Crowther (2019) <DOI:10.1002/sim.8086>. Also includes functions for calculating bootstrap confidence intervals (including normal, basic, studentized, percentile, bias-corrected, and bias-corrected-and-accelerated) with tidy output, as well as for extrapolating confidence interval coverage rates and hypothesis test rejection rates following techniques suggested by Boos and Zhang (2000) <DOI:10.1080/01621459.2000.10474226>.
